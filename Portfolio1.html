                        <p class="BioPara">The following code is a program a group of students and I created to find the most suitable parks in a radius specified by the user and their preference for park activities. The parks used in this code are from southwestern Ontario and the program works by utilizing Arcpy and writing and reading from a CSV. This project was complex and there were a lot of errors that occurred during the various stages, I was a key player in getting the geoprocessing tools to function and analyze the data as well as the problem-solving. This project could be utilized for many different applications, leveraging the same skills and methodology. I am excited to write more programs like this in the future.

# ----------- Provincial Parks in South-Western Ontario -----------
# -------------------Last modified 2023-12-07 -----------------------
# Created By Chun Kit Chung, Naini Singh, Jordan Steinman, Kiran Duwadi and Faith Best
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Kiran Duwadi contributed the ColourSymbology function, testing the code, error handling 
#     and created the test value table, while also helpinhg figure out the main function, 
#     the Selcted parks function and the user input.
# Jordan Steinman created the main program and the main function as well as helped with 
#     error handling, testing the code, error handling and contibuted to the ColourSymbology function.
# Naini Singh started the SelectingParks function and did most of the error handling while also helping 
#     with the ColourSymbology function, the main function and testing the code.
# Chun Kit Chung contributed by creating the ListSelectedPark function and figured out the f string 
#     formating while also working on the loops in the code and helped with error handling. 
# Faith Best worked on the text file function the buffer and intersect as well as the create point 
#     feature function. 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The purpose of this program is to support a user in finding Provincial Parks in South-Western Ontario
    # by creating a search radius around the user's starting location and returning a list with all the
    # parks in their area. This program also allows the user to refine their results by searching only
    # for parks that have the activities they are interested in.
#Assumptions and conditions made that affeced the structing of this program are as follows:
    # The coordinate units are decimal degrees, and search distance units are kilometres
    # The imported data set was modified to include a data set of the 35 Provincial Parks within
    # South-Western Ontario 
    # This program has the park data for camping, hiking and swimming activities. Other activities 
    # not included in this list may still be available at the parks
    # When an activity is not wanted, the park will still stay in the final outputted list but move 
    # down in match ranking 
    # As this dataset is a standalone dataset and does not get updated,users should check park website
    # for availability, hours, or closures
