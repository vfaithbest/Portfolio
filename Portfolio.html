                <div class="contentBG">
                    <p class="BioPara">This map of The Confederation Trail is the culmination of research, cartography and design principles that were acquired over a semester to result in this carefully curated output. Crafted with passion for this trail and its history, this map serves as a quick look at the overall layout of the trail with details added regarding distances from different cities and segments of the trails. As one of the most iconic trails in Canada, and a part of the Trans Canada Trail, the history and experience of travelling any part of this trail inspired me to craft this map. Acquiring data mainly from the PEI government's data portal, I utilized ArcGIS Pro to query, condense and simplify the data to visually communicate the necessary information without cluttering the map output. I utilized ArcGIS Pro to conceptualize the final output of the map and all the work leading up to that point and then used Adobe Illustrator and Map Publisher for the final output.

                <div class="contentBG">
                    <p class="BioPara">This cartographic output was created in ArcGIS Pro from Ontario GeoHUB data, with the idea of finding a great location to see a view of a sunset in Algonquin Park. To start contour lines were obtained and used to generate a DEM and then Slope and Aspect so that I could create an output that had both a southern aspect and a steep slope close to a trail in Algonquin Park. From there, I visually identified the point seen in red and ran the viewshed tool which created the output in orange. This point is already known to many hikers of the area as it is a short hike called the Lookout Trail, primarily hiked for its amazing view at the point I was able to identify through analysis.

                    <p class="BioPara">These cartographic outputs showcase Terrain Mapping and suitability analysis for Bank Swallow Habitat in the Hamilton, Ontario area. Working with a TIN and utilizing it to find a suitable slope and aspect in conjunction with appropriate soil conditions resulted in a small area for a suitable Bank Swallow habitat. However, the process and use of ArcGIS Pro tools to be able to perform such analysis explore the endless possibilities one can achieve with the appropriate data.

                <div class="contentBG">
                    <p class="BioPara">This project had two chartographic outputs, one that focused on the digitizing of land and water features in the Kapitel Area of Sierra Leone, and a second that utilized the digitizing from the first output to analyze cultivation and contamination of waterways.
                        Getting to work on real-world data and cross-reference digitizing efforts from a scanned paper map as well as georeferenced satellite imagery was very interesting and strengthened my skillset for digitizing. The second map analysis was engaging as buffers were created around the swamps and waterways to see which overlapped as these would be areas where contaminants could enter the vital water supply. Overall this project was a well-rounded experience working from generating data, analyzing the data, to then creating an effective output.

Taking into account winter cover, winter food and which locations are within a certain distance according to research on White-Tailed Deer. With so many facets of life ranging from endangered species and environmental concerns, to where to put the next chain store, the options for analysis of this kind are only limited by the available data and the creativity and dedication of the GIS specialist.
